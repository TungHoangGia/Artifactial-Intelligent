# Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains Python scripts using trained AI models to currently perform tasks such as:
- Object/item counting
- Video-based object detection
- Speech-Recognition
- Human(Danger)-Detection
- Human Fall Detection(High-Acc)

## Files
- `object-counting`: Counts the number of items using object detection.
- `object-detection`: Detects objects in video streams.
- `Speech_Recognition`: Detects your voice and run command.
- `Human(Danger)-Detection`: Detects human and if they pass a line in a specific time then it will print Danger text.
- `Human Fall Detection(Single)`: Detects when a singular person fall

## Requirements
- ultralytics
- opencv-python
- ... (Each folder has library requirements comments)
